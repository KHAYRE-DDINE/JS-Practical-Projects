Live Demo : https://khayre-ddine.github.io/JS-Practical-Projects/Websites/My%20Life


This is the first website I implemented after learning HTML5 & CSS3, where I practiced the majority of what I learned in the courses. 

The competencies that I have applied on this website : 

* Menu bar with dropdown 
* Flex 
* Effects on the boxes 
* Animations 
* Responsive design
