**Space tourism multi-page website**

Live demo : https://khayre-ddine.github.io/JS-Practical-Projects/Websites/Space%20Tourism/starter-code/

In this project, I focused on getting data from a JSON file and showing it 
without refreshing the page. Besides, I practiced what I learned 
in the Javascript course.

Features : 
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

The competencies : 
* Flexbox 
* JavaScript / ES6
*  JSON
